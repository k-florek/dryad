# Dryad
Latest Release: ![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/k-florek/dryad)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k-florek/dryad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k-florek/dryad)

Dryad is a pipeline to construct reference free core-genome or SNP phylogenetic trees for examining prokaryote relatedness in outbreaks. Dryad accomplishes this using [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) allowing the pipeline to be run in numerous environments using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [singularity](https://sylabs.io/) either locally or in an HPC or cloud environment. Dryad will perform both a reference free core-genome analysis based off of the approach outlined by [Oakeson et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158193) and/or a SNP analysis using the [CFSAN-SNP](https://snp-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) pipeline.

#### Installing Dryad
Dryad uses a combination of nextflow and containers to function and is dependent on either [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps).

Installing dryad can be done with pip using `pip install dryad`. If you are running Dryad from the git repository, a python dependency needs to be installed via pip using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### Using the pipeline
The pipeline is designed to start from raw Illumina short reads. All reads must be in the same directory. Then start the pipeline using `dryad` and follow the options for selecting and running the appropriate pipeline.
```
usage: dryad [-h] [--output <output_path>] [--core-genome] [--snp] [-ar]
             [-r <path>] [--profile profile_name] [--sep sep_chars]
             reads_path

A comprehensive tree building program.

positional arguments:
  reads_path            Path to the location of the raw reads in the fastq
                        format.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output <output_path>, -o <output_path>
                        Path to ouput directory, default "dryad_results".
  --core-genome, -cg    Construct a core-genome tree.
  --snp, -s             Construct a SNP tree. Note: Requires a reference
                        genome in fasta format (-r).
  -ar                   Detect AR mechanisms.
  -r <path>             Reference genome for SNP pipeline.
  --profile profile_name
                        Specify a custom nextflow profile.
  --sep sep_chars       Dryad identifies sample names from the name of the
                        read file by splitting the name on the specified
                        separating characters, default "_".
```

Both pipelines begin with a quality trimming step to trim the reads of low quality bases at the end of the read using [Trimmomatic v0.39](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), the removal of PhiX contamination using [BBtools v38.76](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/), and the assessment of read quality using [FastQC v0.11.8](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). After processing, the reads are used by each pipeline as needed.  
*Note: Both pipelines can be run automatically in succession using the -cg and -s parameters simultaneously.*

###### Additional workflow parameters
In order to tweak the versions of software used or specific workflow parameters. You can access the configuration files in the [repository](). You can use the custom configuration with the `--profile` flag.

#### Core Genome phylogenetic tree construction
The core genome pipeline takes the trimmed and cleaned reads and infers a phylogenetic tree that can be used for inferring outbreak relatedness. This pipeline is based loosely off of the pipeline described here by [Oakeson et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158193).

Species and MLST type are predicted from the assemblies generated during the core genome pipeline, and assembly quality is evaluated.

Additionally, the core genome pipeline can be run with `-ar` to predict antibiotic resistance genes.

The pipeline uses the following applications and pipelines:

[Shovill v1.0.4](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill)
Shovill is a pipeline centered around SPAdes but alters some of the steps to get similar results in less time.

[Prokka v1.14.5](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)
Prokka is a whole genome annotation tool that is used to annotate the coding regions of the assembly.

[Roary v3.12.0](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Roary)
Roary takes the annotated genomes and constructs a core gene alignment.

[IQ-Tree v1.6.7](http://www.iqtree.org/)
IQ-Tree uses the core gene alignment and creates a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree bootstraped 1000 times.

[Mash v2.1](https://github.com/marbl/Mash)
Mash performs fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash.

[MLST v2.17.6](https://github.com/tseemann/mlst)
MLST scans contig files against PubMLST typing schemes.

[QUAST v5.0.2](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast)
QUAST evaluates genome assemblies.

[AMRFinderPlus v3.1.1](https://github.com/ncbi/amr)
AMRFinderPlus identifies acquired antimicrobial resistance genes.

#### SNP phylogenetic tree construction
The SNP pipeline takes the trimmed and cleaned reads and infers a phylogenetic tree that can be used for inferring outbreak relatedness. The pipeline requires the path to the raw reads (mentioned above) and a reference genome in fasta file format.

The pipeline uses the following applications and pipelines:

[CFSAN SNP Pipeline v2.0.2](https://github.com/CFSAN-Biostatistics/snp-pipeline)

[IQ-Tree v1.6.7](http://www.iqtree.org/)
IQ-Tree uses an alignment of the SNP sites to create a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree bootstrapped 1000 times.

#### Quality Assessment
The results of quality checks from each pipeline are summarized using [MultiQC v1.8](https://multiqc.info/)
